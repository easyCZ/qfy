**Seer** is an open-source implementation of [synthetic monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_monitoring) for HTTP APIs.


**Features**:

* Self-hosted - deploy on your existing infrastructure (e.g. kubernetes)
* Private networks - run inside VPCs without exposing the service to public internet.
* Low-overhead - utilize unused capacity in your existing compute (kubernetes clusters).

**Motivation**

There are a a number of commercial products offering synthetic monitoring ([DataDog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/), [NewRelic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring/), [Sematext](https://sematext.com/synthetic-monitoring/)). This tool aims to provide an alternative which can utilize your existing infrastrucuture excess capacity to reduce extra costs (and dependencies) on third party providers.

## Maturity
Seer is in very early stages of maturity and unsuitable for most workloads.
